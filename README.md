# Heap-sort-algorithm-using-HTML-CSS-JAVASCRIPT-and-Python-flask
 

An interactive full-stack web application that visualizes the Heap Sort algorithm in real time.  
This project is designed to help understand heap operations through dynamic visual feedback using multiple representations.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time Heap Sort visualization
- Array, Binary Tree, and Bar Chart representations
- Support for both **Max Heap** and **Min Heap**
- Step-by-step sorting animations
- Adjustable animation speed
- Clean, modern dashboard UI
- Backend-driven algorithm execution

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

### Frontend
- HTML5
- Tailwind CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Canvas Confetti (for completion animation)

### Backend
- Python
- Flask
- Flask-CORS

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Users insert values or generate a random array.
2. The frontend sends the array and selected heap strategy (Min/Max) to the backend.
3. Flask processes the Heap Sort algorithm and records each step.
4. The backend returns step-by-step states via a REST API.
5. The frontend animates each step across:
   - Array view
   - Tree structure
   - Bar visualization
